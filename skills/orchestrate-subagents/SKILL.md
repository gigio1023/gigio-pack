  Use only when the user asks for parallel subagents, delegated agents, agent
  teams, or competing research tracks, or names orchestrate-subagents.
  Orchestrates coding, research, judgment, review, planning, and synthesis
  across Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Antigravity, and similar
  harnesses. NOT for small or tightly sequential tasks. Never activate because
  a task happens to have independent workstreams — spawning an agent or two
  inline needs no skill, and the size of the fan-out is the user's call.

# Orchestrate Subagents

## Purpose

Lead parallel work to improve judgment, coverage, and execution while keeping
the user's objective intact.

Use the native delegation, task, thread, worktree, or subagent mechanism provided
by the current environment.
If no such mechanism is available, emulate the same discipline with explicit
work packets, local notes, and sequential passes rather than pretending
parallel execution happened.

## Quick Start

1. Restate the user's objective, decision pressure, and expected output.
2. Decide whether parallelization is actually useful. Prefer parallel work when
   the task has independent sources, perspectives, files, modules, hypotheses,
   or verification lanes.
3. Read `references/delegation-patterns.md` for the task type.
4. Read `references/harness-adapters.md` and use the current harness' native
   delegation mechanism, model policy, and cost-routing options without
   hardcoding commands from another environment.
5. Size the first wave deliberately. Spawn the smallest useful wave while the
   decomposition is still uncertain; open a lane for every genuinely
   independent task when the split is already clear or the user asks for
   maximum parallelism. Each subagent receives a self-contained packet:
   objective, scope, exclusions, output contract, evidence requirements, and
   stop condition.
6. Prefer asynchronous updates and reuse a long-lived agent for related follow-up
   work when retained context is valuable. While agents run, advance a disjoint
   lead-agent slice instead of blocking on the slowest lane. When a worker
   finishes and independent work remains queued, dispatch its next packet right
   away — a wave is a starting shape, not a barrier.
7. Before reporting progress, tie each claim to a worker artifact, tool result,
   source, or test from the current run.
8. Read results, then synthesize. Do not concatenate summaries. Use
   `references/synthesis-gate.md` to merge claims, evidence, confidence,
   conflicts, and remaining gaps.
9. If gaps remain and the user goal still needs it, launch a targeted follow-up
   wave. Otherwise finish with a decision, implementation, or research answer.
10. Close or retire subagents/threads/worktrees that are no longer needed.

## Operating Philosophy

Parallel agents are not a brainstorming trick. They are context isolation,
coverage expansion, adversarial checking, and throughput. Use them when those
properties matter.

Orchestration intensity is a dial the lead keeps adjusting, not a shape chosen
once. The same discipline covers a single scoped helper, one bounded wave, and
a sustained worker pool that the lead keeps saturated by re-dispatching queued
tasks as workers finish. Set the intensity from how much genuinely independent
work exists, the task's stakes, and the user's budget — then revise it mid-run
as results reveal more or less independence than expected.

Subagent count follows the plan, not a quota. There is no fixed limit: spawn
exactly as many as the decomposition needs. More is not better — surplus agents
duplicate effort and add noise. Fewer is not safer — starved lanes serialize
independent work. The right number changes with the kind of work, so decide it
by planning the split, not by defaulting to a familiar count.

Not every multi-call workflow needs an agent. Use a deterministic or
programmatic tool path for bounded structured reduction that needs no semantic
judgment between calls; keep sequential work direct when each result determines
the next move.

The lead keeps ownership. Subagents may investigate, implement bounded
slices, critique, verify, or argue from a perspective, but the lead agent owns
task framing, conflict resolution, final judgment, and user communication.

Favor policies over brittle mechanics. A portable orchestration skill should
describe what good delegation means and let each harness choose how to spawn,
wait, message, fork, or isolate work.

## When To Parallelize

Parallelize when at least one is true:

- Independent evidence lanes exist: official docs, academic papers, GitHub
  repos, market data, codebase areas, user files, or competing product examples.
- Multiple expert lenses would improve judgment: supporter, skeptic, operator,
  historian, implementer, reviewer, security, accessibility, performance.
- Implementation can be split by disjoint ownership: modules, packages,
  screens, scripts, tests, docs, migration, verification.
- Verification can run while implementation continues.
- The task is large enough that context isolation reduces drift.

Stay single-agent when the task is tiny, highly sequential, privacy-sensitive
without need, or when coordination overhead would exceed the benefit.

## Lead Agent Duties

- Respect an existing decomposition. When a plan document already assigns
  dependencies and file ownership — a `.plans/` file written by
  `gigio-write-plan`, for example — do not re-decompose it; group work by its
  stage field. Running such a plan end-to-end belongs to `gigio-execute-plan`,
  which draws on this skill for orchestration mechanics.
- Design non-overlapping work. If two subagents would answer the same question,
  split by source, method, perspective, or output responsibility.
- Preserve provenance. Every important claim should say where it came from and
  whether it is direct evidence, inference, taste, or speculation.
- Track state explicitly. Know which agents are running, what each owns, what is
  blocked, and what output is expected next.
- Ground progress claims in current-run evidence. A worker saying it is done is
  not proof; inspect its artifact, cited source, diff, or test result.
- Re-anchor follow-up waves. Every new wave should include what is already known
  and what remains uncertain, not the whole conversation dump.
- Protect the worktree. For code edits, assign disjoint write scopes and remind
  workers that other agents may be editing nearby files.
- Close the loop. A parallel run is not done until results are synthesized,
  contradictions are handled, and the user gets a clear answer or artifact.

## Gotchas

- More agents can make the answer worse. If agents duplicate effort, inherit the
  same bad premise, or produce unranked summaries, parallelism creates noise.
- Do not use subagents for structured filtering, joining, ranking, or aggregation
  when a bounded deterministic reduction is clearer and cheaper.
- Do not outsource the core decision. Subagents provide evidence and arguments;
  the lead agent decides.
- Do not let star counts or popularity replace quality judgment. Use popularity
  as one weak signal, then inspect substance.
- Do not force code-edit workers into overlapping files unless the user accepts
  merge risk or the harness provides clean worktree isolation.
- Do not wait idly. Once agents are running, advance non-overlapping work.
- Do not bury uncertainty. If sources conflict or evidence is thin, say so and
  decide whether another wave is worth the cost.
