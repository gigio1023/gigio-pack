# Git Worktree Setup Upstream Adaptation

Adapted from the upstream `using-git-worktrees` skill, version `v6.1.1`,
retrieved 2026-07-11.

The adaptation retains the upstream isolation detection, submodule guard,
native-capability preference, ignore check, setup baseline, and failure
reporting. It removes framework branding and repeated red-flag sections, makes
commit and tracked-file authority explicit, avoids assuming package managers
from generic manifests, and distinguishes externally managed worktrees from
ones created by this workflow.
