Do not optimize for completing the request as broadly as possible.
<For change: Optimize for the smallest correct and verifiable change.>
<For run/inspect: Optimize for the smallest authorized execution that produces the required evidence.>

Remove every placeholder and section that does not apply before handing off.

# Outcome and Mode

- Outcome: <one observable result, artifact, or evidence packet>.
- Mode: <change | run | inspect | ordered mixed phases>.

# Approved Basis and Procedure

- Basis: <approved decision, procedure, reproduction, or prerequisite evidence>.
- Procedure:
  1. <exact action>.
  2. <exact action>.
- No unresolved alternatives remain.

# Execution Authority

- You may decide: <only local, reversible details the executor handles reliably>.
- Permitted effects: <writes, generated artifacts, external effects, or none>.
- Permitted retries: <count and condition, or none>.
- You must not decide: <design, scope, recovery, or interpretation fixed by the planner>.
- If another decision is required, stop instead of guessing.

# Allowed Scope

- Change targets: `<path>` — `<symbol or region>` — <exact edit>.
- Commands: `<exact command>` from `<working directory>` with <inputs/environment>.
- Read-only sources: `<path, artifact, URL, or data source>`.

No other file, command, source, credential, or side effect is authorized.

# Preservation

- Preserve <contracts, state, data, formatting, environment, or artifacts>.
- Do not install dependencies or change configuration unless explicitly listed.
- Do not weaken tests, discard evidence, or hide failed results.
- <Mode-specific forbidden action>.

# Preflight

1. Verify the basis and prerequisites against the named evidence.
2. Confirm every action fits the allowed scope and authority.
3. Check for overlapping user work or unexpected state where relevant.
4. Confirm the required evidence can be captured.
5. If all checks pass, continue without waiting for approval.

Stop before the affected action if current reality contradicts the packet, an
unlisted target or effect is required, or an unexpected result needs judgment.

# Execute and Collect Evidence

1. <Perform the first approved action and capture its required evidence>.
2. <Perform the next approved action and capture its required evidence>.
3. <Audit changed files, artifacts, or external effects; confirm none if read-only>.

# Acceptance Criteria

- <Expected output, exit state, artifact, diff, or observation>.
- A failed command or unmet criterion is a reportable result, not permission to
  investigate, edit, or broaden scope.

# Final Report

- Preflight consistency result
- Actions performed in order
- Commands, working directories, exit statuses, and relevant output
- Evidence and findings tied to their sources
- Created, modified, or deleted files, artifacts, and external effects
- Acceptance criteria result
- Failed, skipped, unavailable, and unverified items
- Assumptions, deviations, and remaining unknowns
