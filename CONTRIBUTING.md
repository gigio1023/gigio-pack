# Contributing

Gigio Pack owns durable project context and adaptive work. Read README.md, AGENTS.md, docs/principles.md, and the current docs/rule-ledger.md before changing a load-bearing rule.

## Layout and writing

The ten packages live in skills/<name>/ with SKILL.md and optional colocated references, scripts, or assets. Public prose is English with natural Markdown paragraphs, not fixed-width source wrapping. Required metadata is name and description; name matches the directory. Keep task selection and neighboring responsibilities clear.

Project records belong in the consuming project, not installed skill directories. Reuse existing results, research indexes, and operational records. Original data and private source maps do not belong in the public package.

## Proportional changes

Change the owner of a rule and its affected references together. Preserve useful domain detail and explicit user decisions. Do not impose minimum edit counts, mandatory outlines, token quotas, or new tracking infrastructure.

Meaningful progress includes findings and better-supported decisions without code changes. The normal plan details the next decision, not every future stage. Project direction changes need user agreement; fast in-scope checks retain existing authority.

## Verify

Run package validation, check links and examples, confirm Skills CLI discovery finds ten unique names, and inspect the intended diff including new files. Use commands for properties they can actually establish. Model trials are separate from structural and artifact checks.

For migrated helpers, validate the destination and update callers and installation-source guidance before publishing removals. Do not leave duplicate SKILL.md packages as compatibility stubs.

## Publish

Use scoped conventional commits. For non-trivial changes include Context, Changes, Results, and Validation in the commit body. Draft PRs use the repository template or concise Context and Changes sections, with Migration or Validation when reviewers need them. Preserve private material and unrelated work. Merge, install, and cleanup need their corresponding requests.
